I believe having these three types of people in your professional circle will
do you great good:

1. Advocate
   - Knows you on a personal level.
   - Acts as a trusted sounding board.
   - Is able to merge job and values.
2. The Strategic 'In'
   - Well-connected individual.
   - Demonstrates willingness to make connections on your behalf.
   - One who can connect you with others.
3. The Subject Matter Expert
   - Offers superior insight on a specific industry.
   - Can give unbiased opinion.
   - Connecting skills to area of work.
