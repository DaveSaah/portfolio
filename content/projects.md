The projects are listed in no particular order:

### Some -- 2024 (WIP)

This project is a tree-walking interpreter I am building to see, understand and
appreciate what happens when we run high-level programs. The proposed features
include, but is not limited to:

- Simple syntax.
- Variable bindings.
- Data types: integers, booleans.
- Arithmetic expressions.
- Built-in functions (yet to be decided*).
- First class functions.
- Recursion.
- Higher order functions.
- Closures.
- Collection data structures: strings, array, hash tables.

### Days -- 2024

One of the favourite tools I built. It has all the features of a fully functional
cli application.

- Purpose: Calculates the number of days spent on earth.
- Features:

  - Has a config file to customise application.
  - Has command autocompletion script for bash, fish and zsh shells.
  - Allows customisation via cli interface without needing to edit the config file.

### new-cpp-proj -- 2024

I was tired of running `mkdir` and `touch` commands during every lecture, so I
decided to automate the whole process to save time.
The end product was a tool that simplifies the creation of C++ projects.

### Choreflow API -- 2024

I utilised REST principles to design an API that allows users to interact with
a chore management system. I thoroughly documented the API to follow the
OpenAPI Specification standard.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to develop APIs in Go.

### Self Reference -- 2021

When I first came into contact with programming, I had no device to practice
with so I ended up writing everything in a notebook. To preserve the contents
in the book, I built self-reference.

There was not much to learn here since it was a basic static website with html,
css, and markdown. Nonetheless, one valuable skill I learned in the process was
how to host websites using firebase.

### Simple Web Server -- 2023

I built a simple web server to test how http requests and responses work in Go.

### Codereviewshop -- 2021

In order to keep my life organised, I developed a website to allow my classmates
to book a session with me to guide them through various software related tasks.
Some of the services I rendered on codereviewshop included:

- Mentoring
- Pair programming
- Teaching programming languages
- Teaching problem solving
- Teaching how to use software tools like the command line and git.

I no longer use it.

### Codereviewshop's Blog - 2022

Codereviewshop blog is a subsystem of codereviewshop were I shared my lessons and
advice on my programming journey. It was fun building it using hugo. However, I
migrated all the blog content to my official [substack](https://davesaah.substack.com).

### Calculator -- 2020

I built this cli application when I began learning python. Some of the features of
the calculator include:

- Arithmetic operations
- Trignometric operations
- Determining integer identity (odd or even)
- Solving quadratic equations
- Calculating factorials
- and 2D vector arithmetic.

### Item Check Counter -- 2021

This project arose from a frustration generated by having to wait for a shopkeeper
to go through their notebook to find the item I was purchasing. I developed Item
Check Counter to solve the problem I faced that day. The sad part was, I built the
app on my phone at that time and never showed it to the shopkeeper -- it collected
dust on github since then.

The application allows you to keep track of items in stock, add or remove items,
produce receipts, automated stocks update and saving of daily transactions to files
for easy monitoring of day to day transactions.

### IRB Tracker -- 2024

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) Tracking System is a web-based application
designed to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, and managing research
projects within an academic institution.

Though I learned a great deal using htmx and the concept of hypermedia as the engine
of application state, I only did the bare minimum to get my marks for my university
course. It is far from production ready.

[See project on Github](https://github.com/DaveSaah/irb-tracker)

### Todo App -- 2021

This was the first project I built to learn react. In the process, I learned
about the following:

- Javascript promises and asynchronous communications.
- Setting up github actions.
- How to use firebase hosting as well as cloud store database.
- Had my first introduction to bootstrap css.
