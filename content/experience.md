My experiences can be categorised into the following:

1. **Professional:** Involves contributions to projects or organisations that
   are used by people other than myself.
2. **Job Simulations:** Involves participating in job simulations on
   [forage](https://www.theforage.com) to get a sense of what working in a selected
   company looks like.
3. **Academic:** Involves academic timeline, and extracurricular activities.
4. **Miscellaneous:** Includes volunteering and other uncategorised experiences.

## Professional

**IT Intern @ Stanbic Bank Ghana** &emsp;&emsp; _Jul 2023 - Aug 2023_

- Created an XML to CSV converter tool to facilitate streamlined data processing
  for IT Staff.
- Acquired knowledge of the critical role of logs in identifying and resolving
  production issues.

> I was able to grasp the usefulness of logs when there was a bug in production
> and it took a few minutes to resolve because the trail of logs made it easier
> to identify the hotspot and patch it up before any significant damage was done.

- Learned about how rigorous tests and simulations are made to ensure the
  integrity of the banks software and infrastructure.

## Job Simulations

**[Software Engineering @ Goldman Sachs](https://bit.ly/4hgzK0a)** &emsp;&emsp; _June 2023_

- Completed a job simulation as a Goldman Sachs governance analyst responsible
  for assessing IT security and suggesting improvements.
- I learnt about hashing algorithms to understand their usage, strengths and weaknesses.
- I investigated a leaked password database and used [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
  to try and crack them.
- Wrote a memo for my supervisor summarizing my findings, as well as, providing
  recommendations that will increase the companyâ€™s level of password protection.
- **_Skills learned:_**

  - Cryptography basics.
  - Password best practice.
  - Password cracking.

## Miscellaneous

**Tutor @ [ChariotAfrica](https://www.chariotafrica.com/)** &emsp;&emsp; _Mar 2024 - May 2024_

- Assisted the team in setting up devices for basic digital training.
- Provided a workshop on problem-solving. Introduced the students to algorithms
  and how they can apply them to their daily life.

**Unpaid Intern @ [TheStartup&trade;](http://twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen)** &emsp;&emsp; _Sept 2023 - present_

- TheStartup&trade; is software development community led by [ThePrimeagen](https://linktr.ee/ThePrimeagen).
- I participate in conversations about software development and learn from
  experienced seniors, while having fun.

**Linux Ambassador (self made)** &emsp;&emsp; _Sep 2021 - Jan 2025_

- I create awareness of the pros and cons of using Linux.
- I guide new users through initial setup and configuration of the Linux

  2 years because it was unsustainable.
- Refactored [box-cli maker](https://bit.ly/3UkqnTa)
  tool, resulting in reduced code complexity and
  improved maintainability.

  their solutions in python.

**Computer Science Student @ Ashesi University** &emsp;&emsp; _Sept 2021 - present (Jul 2025)_

- Attending leadership seminars to learn what it means to be a leader. This Includes
  but not limited to who a leader is, how they think, how society affects them and
