## Professional

**IT Intern @ Stanbic Bank Ghana** &emsp;&emsp; _Jul 2023 - Aug 2023_

- Created an XML to CSV converter tool to facilitate streamlined data processing
  for IT Staff.
- Acquired knowledge of the critical role of logs in identifying and resolving
  production issues.

> I was able to grasp the usefulness of logs when there was a bug in production
> in one of the banks critical infrastructure and it took a few minutes to resolve
> the issue because the trail of logs made it easier to identify the hotspot and
> patch it up before any significant damage was done.

- Learned about how rigorous tests and simulations are made to ensure the
  integrity of the banks software and infrastructure.

- I investigated a leaked password database and used [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
  to try and crack them.
- Wrote a memo for my supervisor summarizing my findings, as well as, providing
  recommendations that will increase the company’s level of password protection.
