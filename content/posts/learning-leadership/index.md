These notes are guiding principles for myself. I am taking the
account of all the heroes of faith mentioned in the **Hebrews 11**,
as well as, other notable characters I am going to study as examples
of leadership.

## Abel

The story of Abel is seen in **Genesis 4:1-8**. The testimony of 
Abel is that he offered a more acceptable sacrifice. It was 
testified of him that he was righteous and God confirmed this
testimony by accepting his gifts.

### What Really Happened?

*"Abel brought an offering of the finest firstborn of his flock and
the fat portions. And the Lord had respect for Abel and his 
offering."* --Genesis 4:4. An offering of the finest shows that he
gave his best to God. It wasn't the finest of just anything he had,
but the first fruits.

When reading about what happens to the first fruits a tree produces,
I learned that farmers tend to remove the first fruits to encourage
better fruiting in later years. This helps the tree focus on **root 
and branch development** before producing a full harvest.
It means, when God asked us to present our first fruits, it was for
our good; so we can be more rooted in Him. And also, develop as a
branch to produce more fruit.

On the flip side, Abel's brother, Cain was angry that his sacrifice
was rejected. God said: *"If you do well [believing in Me and doing
what is acceptable and pleasing to Me], will you not be accepted?
And if you do not do well [but ignore My instruction], sin crouches
at your door; its desire is for you [to overpower you], but you must
master it."*--Genesis 4:7.

### As a leader...

- Obedience is a more acceptable sacrifice.
- Focus on developing your roots to stand firm; and your branches
to produce more fruit.

## Enoch 

The story of Enoch is in **Genesis 5:21-24**. Enoch pleased God and
was taken to heaven so that he would not have a glimpse of death.
Enoch walked with and pleased God, but it is impossible to please
God without faith. That means Enoch walked by faith alone. This
faith believes that God exists and that God is a rewarder.

### As a leader...

- My decision-making should be from the perspective of faith. What
does that mean? I do not trust myself, but trust God. When I do, He
doesn't expect me to draw back on my word.
- The reward of my work is from God. Do everything as unto God.

One thing I am realising is that it is not about the characters per
se, but what the characters remind me about the life I ought to live
in this world in response to my desire to honour God as a leader.
