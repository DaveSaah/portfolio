Hello there :wave:

I'm someone who cherishes my quiet space, delving into the depths of science and
philosophy whenever possible. There's something about the mysteries of the
universe that captivates me endlessly.

I also enjoy developing software that does not involve building a UI. I thrive
on tackling challenges in systems programming, backend development, crafting
command line tools, or navigating the complexities of Linux systems. It's about
creating something powerful and efficient, hidden from the spotlight, that gets
my gears turning.

Whenever I manage to carve out some time, I join [ThePrimeagen's](https://twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen)
stream. It's my go-to place for soaking up new technologies and innovative
problem-solving techniques. The community inspires me to get better each day.
