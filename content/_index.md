Hello there :wave:

I'm someone who cherishes my quiet space, delving into the depths of science and
philosophy whenever possible.

I also enjoy developing software that does not involve building a UI. I thrive
on tackling challenges in systems programming, backend development, crafting
command line tools, or navigating the complexities of Linux systems. I prefer
creating powerful and efficient software hidden from the spotlight.

Whenever I manage to carve out some time, I join [ThePrimeagen's](https://twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen)
stream. It's my go-to place for soaking up new technologies and innovative
problem-solving techniques. The community inspires me to get better each day.
